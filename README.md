# OSCAL Java Command Line Tool

A Java tool, providing a command line interface, that performs common operations on [Open Security Controls Assessment Language](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/) (OSCAL) and [Metaschema](https://github.com/usnistgov/metaschema) content.

This open-source, tool offers a convenient way to manipulate OSCAL and Metaschema based content supporting the following operations:

- Converting OSCAL content between the OSCAL XML, JSON, and YAML formats.
- Validating an OSCAL resources to ensure it is well-formed and valid.
- Resolving OSCAL Profiles.
- Validating a Metaschema model definition to ensure it is well-formed and valid.
- Generating XML and JSON Schemas from a Metaschema model definition.

This work is intended to make it easier for OSCAL and Metaschema content authors to work with related content.

This tool is based on the [Metaschema Java Tools](https://github.com/usnistgov/metaschema-java) and [OSCAL Java Library](https://github.com/usnistgov/liboscal-java/) projects.

This effort is part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) OSCAL Program.
